<h3 align="left">1. Introduction</h3>
<p align="left">
    


This repository includes the group project of Module 2 of the Web Development bootcamp of Adalab, a Front-End development course focused on women without previous programming knowledge.

This project has been carried out by 5 students and it has been our second collaborative website developed. In this project we have made an interactive web application to create a personalized business card. On the website we can enter our professional data and obtain a layout view with this information.

- <h4 align="left">Specifications</h4>

In the development of this web application we have used the following technologies:

- Advanced use of HTML forms
- Layout using advanced CSS, like flex
- Use of mediaqueries so that the design is adaptable to the device using the mobile first strategy
- Event management in the browser
- Access and send data to a server
- Local storage using LocalStorage
- Using git for project version control
- Publishing the result to the Internet using GitHub Pages
- Handling of Slack, GitHub, GitHub projects, GitHub pages, VSCode, Gulp, Terminal, Zeplin.

- <h4 align="left">Working methodology:</h4>

1. Planning and executing projects under the Scrum/Agile framework.
2. Using git for project version control as a team
3. Publishing the result to the Internet using GitHub Pages
4. Implementation of Scrum as a reference framework for product development, always based on Agile values as key points of teamwork and continuous improvement
5. Fluid communication among team members

- <h4 align="left">How it works</h4>


The application works by following these steps:

- Allow the user to choose the style of the card, choosing a color palette
- Allow the user that, by entering information in a form, this text is displayed automatically laid out in a box similar to a business card, which will be the sample of the final result
- Allow the user to create a website with their card and share it on Twitter

Both pages have an established design. The design is made for 3 device sizes:
**1. Mobile, under 768px**

**2. Tablet, from 768px to 1200px**
**3. Desktop, from 1200px**

<h3 align="left">4. User Stories</h3>
<p align="left">
    
    


For project management, we will use user stories, a tool to define the characteristics of a product.

**1. First. Landing and UI**
-Develop the landing page
-Develop a first basic version of the web, with the layout of the basic structure (for desktop and mobile) that includes the form with the collapsible and the preview

**2. Second. Interactive version**
-Interactive form: when modifying a form field, both the card design and the user data (except the photo), the preview is updated
-Perform form data validations: mandatory fields, email, etc.

**3. Third. Share**
-Photo update in card preview, using provided component
-Add the functionality to share on Twitter, first sending the data to the server to obtain the URL to share

**4. Quarter. Offline version**
-Have content stored in the browser's LocalStorage
